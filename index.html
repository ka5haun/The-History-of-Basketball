    <li>The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).</li>
    <li>A player cannot run with the ball.</li>
    <li>The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.</li>
    <li>No shouldering, holding, pushing, striking, or tripping an opponent.</li>
    <li>A foul is striking the ball with the fist.</li>
    <li>If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it counts as a goal for the opponent.</li>
    <li>A goal is made when the ball is thrown or batted from the ground into the basket and stays there.</li>
