  <p class = "blue">Basketball was invented in December 1891 by James Naismith(image above) in Springfield, Massachusetts. It started off as a game where soccer balls were thrown into peach baskets. Shortly after, the first official game of basketball was played on March 11, 1892. At that time, there was nine players on each team; there is now five on each team which is one way that shows how much the game has changed since then. In 1896, the first college game was played, which marked a milestone in the progression of the popularity. The NBL was made in 1898, but ended briefly only lasting five years. In the 1930s, basketball became an Olympic sport. This was a big deal because it was now a global game that many countries took seriously. In 1949, the NBA was created which still exists today. Chuck Cooper was the first African American to be drafted into the NBA in 1950 which marked the end of segregation in the league.</p>
